LLM Documentation:
    Prompts and Suggestions 1: "Help me make my token counting method better to handle large datasets more efficiently."
    Rationale 1: The original method for counting tokens was not working well and going out of control, especially when processing large datasets. It was based on manual string splitting and token counting, which became slow as the input size increased. 
        AI suggested using more efficient data structures like unordered maps and maps to store the tokens and their frequencies. This approach helped reduce lookup times and made the counting process faster.
    Incremental Development 1: I first implemented the unordered_map to store tokens and their frequencies. After making sure that the token count was accurate, I used a map to sort the frequencies in descending order. This allowed me to process tokens more efficiently and sort them based on their frequencies for easy retrieval.

    Prompts and Suggestions 2: "Can you suggest a way to improve my sorting mechanism to handle frequency sorting in descending order?"
    Rationale 2: Initially, I was using a simple sorting function that didn’t work for descending order or multiple tokens with the same frequency.
        AI suggested using a nested map structure (`map<int, map<string, int>, greater<int>>`) to group tokens by frequency in descending order. This ensured that I could efficiently store and retrieve tokens sorted by frequency without needing to manually sort them.
    Incremental Development 2: I used the suggested map structure into my code, which automatically sorted the tokens by frequency as I inserted them. This reduced the complexity of my sorting step and helped ensure correct order based on token frequency.

    Prompts and Suggestions 3: "Help me improve my program to handle token position tracking more efficiently."
    Rationale 3: I needed to track the positions of tokens based on their sorted frequency, but the initial implementation was inefficient, particularly when checking token positions against the sorted map.
        AI proposed storing the token positions in a list and then iterating through the sorted map to match token positions efficiently. This allowed me to efficiently output the positions of tokens after sorting by frequency.
    Incremental Development 3: I used the AI's suggestion by creating a tracking system for the positions of tokens and ensuring that each token’s position was recorded properly as I iterated through the sorted map.

/*
Debugging and Testing Plan:
    Specific Test 1: I tested the program using the files given with varying token frequencies to check if the program was able to accurately count and sort tokens.
    Issues and Resolutions 1: During initial tests, I found that large input files caused performance issues due to inefficient token counting. This was resolved by using unordered_map for efficient lookup and insertion.
    Verification 1: After optimizing the token counting method, I tested the program with large datasets and confirmed that it handled token counting and sorting quickly and correctly.

    Specific Test 2: I created edge cases by including tokens with multiple occurrences and tested if the tokens were correctly grouped by frequency.
    Issues and Resolutions 2: When i first started the sorting of tokens by frequency wasn’t working as expected due to incorrect implementation of the nested map. I fixed this by changing to the correct map structure (`map<int, map<string, int>, greater<int>>`).
    Verification 2: I ran several test cases with duplicate tokens and verified that they were correctly grouped and sorted in descending order of frequency.

    Specific Test 3: I ran a test where the input file contained only one token to ensure the program could handle minimal input correctly.
    Issues and Resolutions 3: The program initially failed to process files with a single token properly because the token position tracking was not designed for such cases. I added a special case to handle single-token inputs.
    Verification 3: After adding the special case for single-token input, I ran the test again and verified that the program worked correctly for such inputs.
